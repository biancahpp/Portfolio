This app was built using ReactJS and SASS.

## Introduction ##

This application was made so I could display and introduce all of my projects on the same place.

## Getting Started ##

To get started, simply clone this repo, and on your terminal type:

npm install

npm start

If you want to add projects of your own you can use the file projects.json and add the info of your projects there.
